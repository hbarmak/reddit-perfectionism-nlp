engineeringstudents,"Is 20-25 Hours Worth of Homework Per Week ""Normal""?","I am finishing my second semester for a bachelors degree in mechanical engineering. I work part-time and do anywhere between 20-25 hours of homework per week across 5 classes/17 credits not including studying. One of the classes is a fully online pre-calculus course that takes up roughly 10 hours per week. I am more than willing to put in the work required to earn my degree but I am wondering if I should just power through or if I need to reconsider my current studying/homework habits. I am also concerned that more difficult classes will start to take up even more time that I feel like I hardly have now.

Friends and family also insist I seem to be doing too much work but they are different majors, go to different schools, etc. Any and all advice is appreciated. :)",,Parental Expectations & Criticism
engineeringstudents,Should I study biomedical engineering?,"I'm from Easter Europe and I'm currently taking a gap year. I have been accepted into a bachelor's program which is a precursor for studying BME masters. I have always liked the idea of helping people but I also enjoy the technology that engineering deals with. I used to build simple robots when I was younger, programmed some simple games in python and enjoyed the problem solving it involved. 

I'm good at sciences and it's easier to get a medical field job here so I have also applied to medicine, dentistry, veterinary med and physiotherapy. 

Here's the thing, I've started my freshman year studying pharmacy but I dropped it pretty early on. The classes were all very interesting - bio, chem, labs, botany etc but I feel like I missed the problem solving part and the hands on, getting to create stg experience. Everything was cool but it didn't really feel fulfilling and something was just missing.

So my question is for BME students/ graduates, how is the BME field here in Europe? (if you're from somewhere else please feel free to share but also include where you're from) Job market, salaries, employability and maybe even the studying itself. I have noticed that a lot of people don't pass the exams here and maths/physics classes have around 50-75% (per semester) fail rate which is a lot. Imagine only 50% of people passing the first part of the class only for half of them to fail the same class but second part next semester eg. Math I, Math II... I know it's gonna include a lot of maths but what about the other classes that you took, which one was the most fun for you? 

I'm trying to decide if following what I want to do is the right choice here because I don't want to end up jobless and homeless when I could study other med related fields which earn a lot of money. They are all kind of missing the building stuff part whereas BME seems to encompass everything I enjoy. So I guess I'm trying to get a better idea of what the actual job/ studying is like.",,Concern Over Mistakes

engineeringstudents,Deciding between mechanical or electrical engineering,"For context I am in year 12 Australia and I want to do engineering at uni. My favourite topics in physics are thermodynamics, waves, gravitational and magnetic fields. My hobbies include music production (beats) and learning about effects and I also know how to do some sound design. I also do arduino which is okay but at times hard to motivate myself to keep learning - I enjoy doing the projects of my own and solving problems. Calculus, quadratics and anything I can visualise within maths is what I enjoy and score the best in those areas as well as statistics (I hate probability and binomial theorem/logs stuff lol). I am more of a mechanica/spatial mind which leads me to aerospace or mechanical engineering - more so the design part as I am more of a creative person. My dilemma is that I personally believe electrical engineering is the future and whilst I also believe I could be capable of it (my grandpa worked as a telecommunications technician and installed the first optic fibres here in australia if that is useful at all lol) it may be harder and less interesting for me and it would likely lead to a better income and allow me to do hobby synth building as an example due to my interest in music. I also have an interest in renewables - solar panels and wind turbines but also have a passion for space and defence stuff.

engineeringstudents,Lost on which major to decide.,"I'm currently a junior in highschool who's planning to take all dual credit classes at a community college and a university in the fall (After this semester ends, I'll be done with my Associate's degree). And I want advice to help me decide my major. I have to register for fall classes tomorrow, and I'm currently just registering for a mix of business and engineering classes as of right now.

I'm currently a business management major, but I heard about the lack of job security and competitiveness of it. I chose it because I didn't know what else, and I like learning about businesses and how to run them too.
I've been leaning towards engineering (mechanical or civil).

Started considering engineering because of money, and math is my strongest subject. Wouldn't say that I love it or am super passionate about it. Just not sure if I'm fascinated with the idea of problem solving and tinkering and building things tho.

So yeah...I would love to hear from engineers, or anybody in general who has advice to offer.üôèüèº",,Organization

engineeringstudents,Upcoming dugout/bat project,"IMPORTANT NOTE: I'm not an engineering major. I am a business management major. Yes - I spent the past three classes coloring and making card cut outs. The stereotypes are generally true. 

Now that that's out of the way. I am based in Ohio and I'm trying to create a business to enter the marijuana industry (freshly legalized in Ohio, yippee!). I'd like to work my way into selling my own ""plant material"" but that's expensive and I am merely a poor college student. Obviously, this isn't about the ""plant material"". I want to enter the industry with accessories. So with that, we can segway into my project.

I want a device that can store, dispense, and ignite all on it's own. My idea is that of the likes of the PAX Dry Herb Vaporizer (link: [https://www.pax.com/vapes/categories/vaporizers](https://www.pax.com/vapes/categories/vaporizers) ). About the size of a regular BIC lighter, a little bigger but not by much. It has to be sleek but durable. Here is where my idea potentially stands out. I want it to be able to store the herb, with a little button that in a sense pushes the herb from the storage compartment into the ignition chamber. It needs to heat/ignite without exploding but able to heat it without combusting the rest of the herb that sits in the storage (the part that pushes the herb from storage to ignition needs to be a one way thing and sealed).

So, here's my dilemma. As you have seen, I have an idea planned out and I am also a business major who understands high school introductory engineering (take that with a grain of salt) but nothing beyond it. I guess my questions are: Where do I start with this project? How do I start with this project? Who should I seek out to help me? How does the functionality of it sound? Is it mechanically sound? Is there potential? Being a business major, I am also not really sure on what questions to ask but I made a mock up 2D drawing (sorry for the poor handwriting).

Money-wise: I am international, so I'm not considered instate for any of these schools. Money is not a big problem. UF is cheaper, and the other three have similar price tags.

* VT: beautiful campus, great football scene, nationally more well-known engineering program, many competitive student teams for engineering, remote(not many internship opportunities? boring?)
* UW: highly ranked worldwide, in a big tech city(more opportunities?), too many weed-out classes, rainy & cloudy weather might be depressing, higher academic pressure due to quarter system(not sure about this)

# What is Razen?

Razen is a lightweight, beginner-friendly language designed with flexibility and simplicity in mind. I wanted something that felt different from most traditional languages ‚Äî more expressive, less rigid. It‚Äôs still in active development, but the idea is to make it both fun and functional.

# What‚Äôs New?

* **New Features & Keywords** Added things like `razen:freestyle` for more open, dynamic logic. Also improved how variables work and cleaned up a lot of syntax.
* **Core Improvements** Performance is better, codebase is more organized, and things are just more stable overall.

# Try It Out

perfectionism,What is perfectionism like to you?,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôm a psychologist (and fellow perfectionist!) and I‚Äôm really interested hearing what the average ‚Äòperfectionist‚Äô experiences day-to-day, especially when it shows up alongside anxiety, overthinking, or burnout (as it so often does!)

If you‚Äôre open to sharing, I‚Äôd love to hear:
1. What genuinely helps you feel more grounded or kinder to yourself when the pressure hits?

2. What have you tried that hasn‚Äôt worked? Or felt unrealistic or too hard to keep up?

3. Are there tools, supports, or resources you wish existed but haven‚Äôt found yet?

4. What tends to get in the way of doing the things that do help?

perfectionism,"Okay, I have to listen to other people","I'm obsessed with being the perfect human, with perfect productivity, zero time wasted, like a machine, a robot. Why? Because I'm too scared to show the real me, the real me who scrolls on social media all day, the real me who would like to play video games all day, the real me who is a nerd, the real me who is socially incompetent. I don't like showing myself.

But the problem is, by pretending to be a robot, I actually manage to achieve less than if I would just accept I am a human. No one likes a robot. So, by trying to be the perfect human who is super social, has lots of friends etc., I'm actually the loniest person.

But there is something that scares me to show my real self. Rejection. Fear. Panic. Because the real self doesn't like following rules. The real self doesn't like following anything. The real self would like to never speak with any human again. The real self would just like to be a hedonist, partying all day, and doing nothing productive.

But I don't want to be that person. I can't. I know I am a hedonist. But I don't want to be one. Because it's wrong. Fundamentally wrong. It achieves nothing. I am a hedonist, because I know, nothing you do in life gives any purpose. The only thing giving purpose is happy hormones. Nothing more. And it does not matter \*how\* you achieve those happy hormones, it's just the longer you experience them, the better.

But I don't just want to crash and burn in 5 years. I want to sustain happiness for longer than that. But, that seems impossible to me, because if you try to sustain happiness, delayed gratification, you are never happy, ever. And so I am never me. But a robot. 

But, again. People hate robots. They hate inauthenticity. They want to see a real self. They want to see me. And if that means that they see a hedonist. They want to see someone \*real\*, not someone pretending to be someone they aren't. Because that's not a human then. But a robot. They don't want to see a robot that works all day, like a slave. They want to see a \*human\*, they want to see \*human\* expression.

And every single person tells me that: Stop trying to be something you aren't. Stop being a robot. Why do you persist on being a robot? Why? My parents asked this when I was younger: Why do you insist on being something you aren't? Why do you insist being a robot? Friends in school asked this: Why do you persist on being a robot? Why? Therapists asked this, psychiatrists asked this: Why do you want be a robot? Why?

Why? Because I don't want to feel like a failure. That's why. I know the brain is capable of rational thinking 24/7, and anything below that disgusts me. Doing something just because I ""like"" it is so subjective, it wants me to throw up. I want to have a why. For anything. I don't want to act based on emotions, because I don't want to act based on something that cannot be explained by rationality.

I fear expressing me because it's irrational to express myself. Where do my desires come from, my hobbies, what I look for in people, what attracts me, what makes me happy? See? There is nothing rational for that. And that disgusts me, because I don't know where the hell those things come from. There is no why, no reason, and I don't like acting without reason. I don't like acting without being able to explain in hindsight \*why\* I acted like this, to the very last detail.

But why don't I realize that thinking I should act rational all the time, that this thought is already irrational? I think this is the solution to the problem: Anything I do is irrational. Even thinking that I should think rationally is irrational.

And I should be a human. I have to. I should try to be something I am not. Other people were right. They were all right. I need to stop this nonsense. Now. I need to be a human, me, not a robot.",,"Concern Over Mistakes, Parental Expectations & Criticism, Personal Standards"
perfectionism,I‚Äôm always penalized for being a perfectionist.,"Hi, I‚Äôm an architect, but I mostly work in illustration and graphic design. At architecture school, I learned‚Äîthrough sweat and suffering‚Äîthat everything has to be measured, that everything has to be placed a certain way, that one miscalculation can lead to mistakes in the rest of your work. Basically, they taught us to be obsessive about order, discipline, and precision.

I finished my degree and then started dabbling in graphic design, teaching myself as I went. That led me to enter competitions where I almost never made the deadline. If a poster contest had a Monday deadline, I could easily have it ready by Tuesday, but on Monday it still wasn‚Äôt perfect. To me, it seems absurd‚Äîjust 24 more hours, life is long, and I‚Äôve put in the work. So what‚Äôs the problem? (Yes, I'm kind on naive in that aspect)

Sure, following that reasoning, anyone could just do whatever they wanted and there‚Äôd be no rules. But when you don‚Äôt want to submit something that‚Äôs only 85% done because you know that with 24 more hours you can deliver 95%, what‚Äôs the real issue?

Last year, I enrolled in a product design course. The system was very different: everything was submitted through a platform. If you turned something in late, it would say ‚Äúsubmitted late,‚Äù and you‚Äôd get points deducted. So instead of a 10, the teacher would give me a 9 or a 9.2.

I‚Äôm 38 now, and I really believe we should be able to reason things out and talk them through‚Äîespecially if you know you‚Äôre doing GOOD work.

This year I enrolled in an online university. One of the assignments was to deliver a photogrammetric survey of ONE sculpture. The required submission was just TWO screenshots. But I chose to create two 20-page reports on FOUR sculptures, with reflections and comparisons included. The maximum grade is 100 out of 100. The deadline was April 6, but the extended deadline is June 15. The issue? If you submit after April 6, the maximum score drops to 50 out of 100. So all my work, all those hours working and being a perfectionist, means just a 50. Another person may have obtained a 100 without doing all my effort.

I submitted mine 27 hours late, but I did a better job. Did I submit more than what was asked? Yes. Did I deliver something better? Yes. Did I show more interest and effort? Yes. So why is the responsible and perfectionist person penalized?

I know this is mainly a personal problem‚Äîmy inability to plan long-term. But it causes me huge insecurity because I feel like I‚Äôll never be able to work in a creative job. These past years I‚Äôve been self-taught and didn‚Äôt worry much about deadlines. But when I‚Äôm doing a course, I know I‚Äôll be ‚Äúthat person‚Äù who always needs more time. I ALWAYS need more time.

I‚Äôm exhausted from perfectionism, and I think this is all because of Architecture, it kind of makes my life terrible, and it has me trapped. I know that society has rules and deadlines, but from where I stand at 38, I believe life is long, the world won‚Äôt end over a few extra hours, and people should trust those who can give their best‚Äîif just given a little more time.

perfectionism,unnecessary sh*t???,"so, on Tuesday, it was my boss's kid's first birthday. All the workers decided to buy a single present for the little one, just like we did for his older child. The thing is, I had to take care of it (and this is the first time i take care of gifts at work)  So, I bought the gift, and the store sent it to me that same day.

Here‚Äôs the problem... The package had a HUGE sticker with my address, name, and all that (I guess they put it there to ship it to my home). I tried to carefully peel it off, but um... yeah... there's still a HUGE mark on the box, and it doesn't look good. I tried covering it with stickers, which helped a bit, but you can still tell I put them there just to cover something.

This is where my perfectionism kicks in. I want the gift to be perfect... and I‚Äôm actually considering going to their store (which is like an hour away from where I live) just to buy the SAME product again, just to make sure it doesn‚Äôt have the sticker on it. So yeah, I‚Äôm willing to buy the exact same thing JUST for the sake of... idk, making sure it looks good.

Is that too crazy? I know it‚Äôs a small thing, but holy shit. Is this OCD or just anxiety? idk. i'm willing to waste my money for this. And at the same time, i KNOW it's not a big deal. I know i can just explain what happened to my boss and co workers, and it wouldn't matter because what matters is the toy that's inside! god, i could even drop the box and wrap the toy as a gift. but yk, the box adds to the value of the product in this case, so i don't think i'm gonna do that. 

this is so so tiring... now i'm better, but the last two days i've been thinking about this over and over trying to find alternatives... and it really stresses me out. that's why i want to just go to the store and buy a new one... it's like the ""safest"" (yet more exhausting) alternative for me, to make sure everything is perfect....

perfectionism,"Had a breakthrough about my life and perfectionism the other day. Who are you trying to impress, and why?","Who are you trying to impress? Society? Your parents? Your coworkers? Yourself? Why do you even care what they think anyway (especially if you're an adult)? Do you find their opinion more valid than your own? Why do you think you can never make mistakes? I've been living life like I'm going to be graded by some cosmic authority figure when I die, and get a stern talking-to (but I'm agnostic atheist). But I don't actually believe that's going to happen. The truth is, now as an adult who doesn't need to rely on and please other people as much, I'm NOT actually trying to impress anyone! It's just a deeply engrained bad habit! 

I would always look at my classmates and wonder ""what is going on inside their head?"" (Inside Out reference, haha. Actually, that's a great movie for perfectionists to watch too. The second one. I highly recommend it!) I would wonder how they could take risks, make mistakes, embarrass themselves, and be ok with it. How it didn't take their self esteem down a notch every time. 

You know, I think some of it just naturally comes with age, my mindset shifted as I began to heal after graduating (I'm 21). So you definitely still have to be patient for the emotional side of your brain to catch up with the logical side. It takes time, and that's SO frustrating, but you will get there, trust me. Funnily enough, part of healing from perfectionism is realizing that you don't have to do it super fast or all at once, and to not compare yourself to others too much. 

But I realized two things, about how my classmates acted as they did. The first one is, that they know they only have one life. They don't want to be laying on their deathbed and regret all the things they never did because they were too nervous. People tend to regret what they DON'T do more in the end. What will living a ""perfect"" life as mistake-free as possible have gotten you in the end? A bit of pride? Loneliness? A reputation for being boring? No thanks! Still try to be a good person of course, but...

Point 2: Don't take yourself so seriously! We need to be able to laugh at ourselves! My self esteem used the be so fragile that even a tiny frustration such as not being able to figure out how to progress in a video game, or dropping a glass, could send me spiralling into a self-hating meltdown. I was always subconsciously looking for proof that I was a failure and that I'd never be good enough. But honestly? F**K ""good enough""! Perfect is the enemy of good anyway. 

(Good is better than nothing, because no matter how ""perfect"" you get something, it will never be perfect ENOUGH. Perfect is an impossible to reach ever-shifting goalpost. Chasing it will only exhaust and discourage you.) We're human. We make mistakes, we learn, it's not a big deal. No one needs to be perfect, and no one is expected to be perfect. Who do YOU want to be? Do you ACTUALLY genuinely care about your video game skills, or is this really about other people's/society's perception of you, and your desperation for external validation? END OF POINT 2. 

I got thinking about all this because I was trying to figure out if I should get a certain tattoo, which would be my first tattoo ever. It's from a show that means a lot to me, and I really want it. I was always scared of tattoos before, because of how permanent they are, and how scared I was of making mistakes and not being perfect. And to have a reminder of my foolishness on my body forever?? Terrifying!! But now, since I've realized that mistakes don't actually matter that much and I want to live my life to the fullest (and I've been thinking about this for a long time and done my research), it doesn't seem like such a big deal anymore. 

It would just go on my ankle, so it's not something drastic like a face tattoo, and I really like the design. It's simple and small-medium sized, and something probably only other fans of the show would recognize. But it still looks nice to people who don't know what it means, and to me. Baby steps. I've never been into fashion or color coordination, I don't care if tattoo colors clash with my clothes. Why not adorn my plain skin with beautiful swirling love for my favorite things? My fear has often held me back in life, but when I have taken risks, it ended up going very well. 

The biggest one was when I cut my hair short after having it be really long my whole life. I could never want to have long hair again now, I like it so much better short. And also when I learned to drive, and when I went out to meet potential new friends, when I came out to my parents, and when I gave Star Trek a chance because my Dad recommended it, and now I'm a Trekkie! I know not all risks pay off, but it's good to be able to laugh at yourself. It's natural that people change over their life. I doubt I'll ever stop loving The Owl House, but in a few decades, on the small chance that I did, I STILL wouldn't regret the tattoo. It would have helped me break my metaphorical chains, and start to REALLY live life. 

If I never got a tattoo because my interests might change, I wouldn't get one until I WAS literally on my deathbed, and that would just be ridiculous! There would be no point anymore. I feel that looking back at an old tattoo, as long as it is aesthetically pleasing, is not regretful, but rather simply a reminder of who you used to be. It's inspiring, it's funny, and it shows you how much you've grown. Take the risk, and laugh at yourself after! You only have one life, make it one bursting with stories and experiences. A permanent tattoo, isn't quite as daunting as I always thought it was. But a boring life ruled by FEAR? Now THAT, IS. I don't regret remembering things that I love. And I'm not scared to change. 

Empower yourself by laughing at yourself, and letting go as best you can. It feels SO GOOD. üòÇ To have all that weight of pressure and expectations finally be lifted. It's YOUR life, do what you want with it! Don't waste time on other people's problems that they project onto you. You've got this! You know what's best, and even if you make a mistake, who cares?! You'll learn from it, and that's what matters. Only compare yourself to your past self, not others. And don't worry, growth isn't completely linear.

perfectionism,"""Perfecting something doesn't entitle you to anything.""","Offhand quote my friend said that stuck with me for a while and I wanted to share it.

If I produce a masterpiece, it doesn‚Äôt ensure that it will sell.

If I achieve a PhD and perfect grades, it's not going to automatically land me a job.

If I trained a perfect physique, it will not guarantee a relationship.

Sure, being perfect can help reach your goals, but it's not really worth all that time and energy trying to make it flawless when someone else can half-ass it with way less work and still get the same result if not better. (And they will probably have fun doing it too, dammit.)

Produce things because you love creating. Study because you are obsessed. Train to gain health. See the task for what it is and let doing things be it's own reward, not as precursors to something more.

We‚Äôre exploring the relationship between perfectionism and workaholism‚Äîhow personal standards and self-imposed pressure may relate to work addiction. To do this, we‚Äôre using two well-established psychological scales:

Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (MPS) ‚Äì Identifies whether you lean more toward Self-Oriented Perfectionism (SOP) (setting high personal standards) or Socially Prescribed Perfectionism (SPP) (feeling pressure from others).

Work Addiction Risk Test (WART) ‚Äì Measures how much work impacts your daily life and whether you show signs of workaholism.  
  
Anyone can participate! Whether you consider yourself a perfectionist, a workaholic, both, or neither, your responses will help us understand different motivation patterns.  
  
It should take about 10 - 20 minutes to complete! There are 55 questions all together and they follow the Likert scale of 1 to 7 and 1 to 4.

I feel like I have to watch every single episode of a show to be able to say I've watched it, I don't know who I think will be judging me but my brain thinks everyone. I watched Gilmore Girls for the first time recently and stopped enjoying it after season 4, I still had to finish it. I'd told people I was watching it so had to see it through to the end even though if I watch it again I'd definitely stop at 4. 

I've just started watching Supernatural, which is pretty lengthy at 15 seasons and 22ish episodes per season. I'm only on season 3 but I think because I'm seeing content around it on social media I feel so much pressure from nowhere to finish it and make sure I watch every single episode and understand every reference. I enjoy the fun episodes the most but my brain doesn't give me the ability to skip episodes if I'm not enjoying them. I think I'm scared people are going to call me a 'fake fan' - which I know is completely absurd because I'm a grown woman and literally no one I know has even seen this show. 

  
I used to watch shows just when they were on TV and whatever order they were being played in yet with streaming services I could never do that now.

perfectionism,"Is the book ""The Anxious Perfectionist"" worth powering through? It's not great so far","After reading first 1\\3 of the book i really have doubts author's writing skills, or if they're a real researcher at all. (I don't know much about them, this is just a feeling from reading the book)

Not just the pacing is bad (it took 1\\4 of the book to get to the point, with every chapter starting with saying what's already been mentioned in the book), the examples are even worse, and the thoughts and assumptions brought in the book are not backed up by anything - which just ends up in me constantly wondering if the author uses the right word for what they're trying to describe. So i end up with nothing but confusion and questions to the author, which, of course, will be unanswered.

So it's just a collection of author's beliefs and assumptions, given without any ""proof"" behind them.

For example, the most recent one: ""thoughts and feelings don't cause behaviors"" - is there something that brain can formulate for a person except thoughts and feelings? i know both are made-up concepts, so maybe with that generalizing something was lost, but then what is it? or maybe ""behaviors"" are meant as a metric, where you can only judge it when it manifested itself in the world by the person, and is no more than a statistic? ffs, don't people eat because they FEEL hunger, or because they THINK that it's time to eat to keep a healthy diet? Then what that phrasing was supposed to mean??

So, how does author backs that up? By saying that ""intuitively you know this"", and making an analogy\\parallel to a completely different idea, that has a connection in the author's perception but failed to be translated through the book.

i'll power through and read further, but this is not looking bright. I wonder what others think about the book, and maybe someone can educate me on how to understand it.

edit: well, it got better starting from chapter 5. Before that it was rally weird, with examples or thoughts provided based on questionable things. I still have to be vigilant on what i'm currently reading and what author means.  
At least i'm not mad or lost from the book anymore, there's value now.  
Still don't like how the author ends things with ""rhetorical"" questions that aren't actually rhetorical if something brought you to read this book. I'm looking for answers, not for a weird form of bullying.",,"Concern Over Mistakes, Doubts About Actions, Personal Standards"

So. This is tricky, and I want to ask for some advice... if anyone has it or has experienced something like this.

I am stuck in a bit of a cycle. I want to start doing things like working out, starting a skin care regime and reconnecting with voice training.

However - since working on my perfectionism a bit, I keep getting stuck in my head about this, because I start to work on a goal, but then get into a loop of feeling like I should be happy with the way I look, and I should just accept the way I am and not try to change myself. It feels like I am somehow not being kind to myself to keep pushing myself to be MORE, but also I am not happy with where I am. I end up sort of immobilised.

My question is, how do you personally work towards goals motivated by genuine compassion for yourself and a healthy drive to get to that goal, rather than being motivated by an obsession to get a more ""perfect"" destination and be perfect or excel in that area?

If I could get any ideas to try, that would really help.

perfectionism,"Hello, I hope everyone is well.","Greetings, my name is Mario, and I am a reformed perfectionist. I have walked through the depths of this struggle, and now, I stand with my heart open and eager to help others who find themselves lost in its grip. 

After years of introspection and learning, I‚Äôve compiled a book on perfectionism, a journey that was both intensely personal and profoundly liberating. entering the world of screenwriting has made me a super perfectionist. 

For over 35 years, I have found joy in the vast field of psychology, seeking understanding, clarity, and ultimately, a way out. it wasn‚Äôt easy matter fact, it was hard. I am not a psychologist by any means, yet I love the topic and I research it all the time. 

Through that pursuit, I‚Äôve arrived at a place of deep, contemplation‚Äîan understanding of why we do what we do. It‚Äôs a clarity that, while it was hard-won, it has become the foundation of my life.

To all those suffering from perfectionism, I send my heart to you. The pain is real, and I know of it first hand. It is an internal, silent pain that chews away at the core of who we are. 

The weight of it often feels unbearable, as if each moment is spent battling an intern force, and it breaks my heart to witness others go through.

But there‚Äôs something else I‚Äôve come to know through my own experience: perfectionism, in all its complexity, is not an enemy we can‚Äôt understand. It is a part of us, born of deep internal conflict, and I now see it for what it truly is‚Äîa cry for balance, for acceptance, for love.

I stand here today, fully embracing all of this, and with that, I extend my hand to anyone who feels the suffocating embrace of perfectionism. There is a way out, and I‚Äôve found it. There is no silver bullets just pure understanding‚Ä¶

I wish all of you well and all I would love to see is peace for you internally.

perfectionism,"My perfectionism regarding decisions isn't improving, but ruining my life","I am an obesessive perfectionist, when it comes to making decisions. Combined with ADHD and a depressive episode, this is not a good thing, as it renders me completely unable of making good decisions, and even more unable of dealing with not having made the perfect one.


And very very likely, if I have to decide between two options, I will obsess so much about which one to pick that very often I will end up losing both.
It can be something as simple as trying to find the perfect place to watch the sunset while on vacation. Maybe there are only 2 days left and I start to completely obsess about when to watch the sunset at which place. I will start to include route planning, even checking sun shade maps online, local cloud coverage data and forecast, etc., it gets to an extreme level of over-analyzing (typical for ADHD), and if I'm lucky, I will have made the right choice by then, and then it's pure bliss (as long as it lasts...until the next decision arises), but if it's the wrong spot, I will label it as a fail immediately and will be unable to enjoy it.

It's even worse when I mess up my time planning. Let's say I have 10 days of vacation, I feel like I wanna squeeze out every possible day as much as possible and spend it at the best possible place. The process alone is so stressful that I usually end up being completely exhausted after a longer time off work.


The last part is hindsight regret. Usually, the second a decision is irreversible, some detail that I overlooked or couldn't have known before will show up, making me realize that I've made the wrong choice. And then it starts spiraling and spiraling down into a cycle of self-loathing, self-blame and self-punishment, catastrophizing the status quo and making up the most vivid scenarios of how different it could've been if I had decided otherwise.


This is ruining my life and exhausting me to a seriously critical extent. I'm looking forward to the start of my therapy and hopefully I'll also be able to get some meds to work with.

I used to love reading as a teenager, but during university, I hardly read at all. Now that I'm in my 20s, I really want to return to that hobby, as it once meant so much to me. I loved getting lost in a good book, escaping reality, and forgetting everything else.
But now, reading is no longer enjoyable for me. It's far from relaxing. My perfectionism has ruined it‚Äî I get caught up in unnecessary details. I often find myself rereading things, sometimes even flipping back to the previous page of my Kindle just to reread a sentence because I can't remember the exact wording. It's not that I have trouble understanding what I'm reading; I get the meaning just fine after reading it once. But then, I‚Äôll think, ""Wasn‚Äôt something similar mentioned earlier?"" and feel the need to find it before I can continue. Or, if I come across a name or place I think I‚Äôve seen before, I have to go back and find the exact sentence again.

I have decided this is the year to try and begin to tackle my Perfectionism. It's a lifelong issue that has destroyed my self-esteem, is tanking my relationships with everyone around me and ability to enjoy... anything, and is further impacted by being Autistic, as it's wrapped up in how I mask.

I finished Brene Brown's the Gifts of Imperfection today. I found it a hard read, but one that has made me feel hopeful.

Now don't get me wrong, the comparison to spirituality actually is something that really resonates with me, but I am not religious. Some of the later examples in some of the are referenced in relation to God  rather than wider spirituality, and I find this hard to relate to. It made me feel strangely isolated from some of the parts of this book that were starting to feel very impactful for me.

perfectionism,How Frustration Fuels Perfectionism,"**Why Perfectionism Keeps You Doing All the Work**

Perfectionists often work against their own best interests without realizing it. They push themselves harder than others, believing that hard work alone will lead to success. But by doing so, they unknowingly place themselves at the bottom of the social hierarchy.

In group dynamics, work is often unfairly distributed, with some people relying on others to do the heavy lifting. Perfectionists, who are driven to get things right, often end up doing the majority of the work, as others take advantage of their dedication and willingness to take on more. This pattern is reinforced by past experiences where they were expected to handle more, solidifying their lower position as the one who bears most of the work load.

The result is a quiet resentment that builds over time. Perfectionists feel frustrated by the lack of recognition for their efforts and become isolated, believing no one else can do things as well as they can. They push others away and take on more responsibility, growing increasingly disconnected.

Perfectionists refuse to play the social games others use to their advantage. They believe that working harder will get them noticed, but this is rarely the case. Instead, humans naturally seek to invest as little as possible to get the most return.

In most hierarchies, those at the top end up doing the least, delegating the difficult tasks to those at the bottom. Perfectionists, invested in their work, are the ones who end up carrying the load while others benefit.

&nbsp;

**How Frustration Reinforces the Perfectionism Loop**

The cycle of working harder and getting less in return becomes an addictive reinforcement. Every time a perfectionist puts in more effort and doesn‚Äôt see the reward they expect, frustration builds. But here‚Äôs the kicker: frustration actually makes people invest more.

&nbsp;

*The Thrill of the Chase*: For perfectionists, it‚Äôs not just about completing a task‚Äîit‚Äôs about the idea of making it perfect. The excitement of possibly achieving flawlessness releases dopamine, but the pursuit of an ideal state can make it harder to actually finish anything. The more perfect something could be, the more time and energy are spent refining it, risking burnout along the way. The appeal of perfection becomes so intoxicating that the idea of the end result can often feel less important than the outcome itself.

&nbsp;

*The More We‚Äôre Denied, The Stronger the Desire*: When perfectionists don‚Äôt get the recognition or success they expect, their desire to prove themselves only grows stronger. If rewards‚Äîlike praise, validation, or success‚Äîare inconsistent or infrequent, they become even more valuable in their minds. This cycle of working hard for little recognition, followed by rare moments of success, keeps them chasing perfection, often becoming more fixated on the pursuit than the outcome itself.

&nbsp;

**Where Perfectionism Started**

It‚Äôs often been this way since childhood. A lot of perfectionists often had to mature faster than their peers in childhood, taking on responsibilities they shouldn‚Äôt have had at such a young age. Or they were pressured to have a sense of obligation to prove themselves, leading them to take on more than they should have. While this gave them a sense of importance or control, it also set the stage for a pattern of always feeling like they had to do everything themselves. Instead of learning how to share responsibilities and trust others, they were conditioned to believe that if they didn‚Äôt do it all, nothing would get done right.

perfectionism,"Help - 26F, cannot control mind, ruined relationships, scared to self sabotage","Hi, would love to hear your thoughts. Long story not very short, I need help. I‚Äôm 26, smart, kind, but something is off in my brain maybe due to perfectionism. My relationship ended with an incredible guy because I couldn‚Äôt stop my brain from picking him apart - he‚Äôs not ambitious enough (had a hiccup at work), I don‚Äôt feel ‚Äúfinancially safe‚Äù with him, etc when he treated me like a queen. I was protecting some f‚Äôd up unrealistic expectations on him. Was it my intuition and we were not meant to be? Or are these my intrusive thoughts messing everything up? I don‚Äôt know how to trust my own brain and heart. It scares me.

I went through life changes of moving home from a different country, working at a bank in private equity and burning out (I‚Äôm not a shark, I‚Äôm just curious about the world and a bit of a romantic), I‚Äôm aiming for perfection in my masters right now. I put way too much emphasis on work in my life (also what caused this tension between the guy, who had a much more balanced approach). 

This perfect do do do thinking is crumbling a beautiful life around me. Obviously I recognize it after I end this relationship and the poor guy doesn‚Äôt want to try again (I don‚Äôt blame him). I‚Äôm waking up in the middle of the night with fear/anxiety spreading in my chest. 

I think the perfectionism comes from wanting to be accepted? I grew up in a wealthy area and I felt this divide between ‚Äúthem‚Äù and me, and by being perfect I thought I could fit into this area. I‚Äôve always had friends, am social etc so I‚Äôm feeling very confused. I‚Äôm so hard on myself and don‚Äôt know how to stop, because I am literally sabotaging the good in my life.

I don‚Äôt know how to accept myself without pushing my limits, and clearly not being able to accept my partners. I want this pattern stop. I‚Äôm scared at 26 it‚Äôs too late, which sounds so silly. I‚Äôm also wearing out my mum who emphasizes ‚Äúwe are family we help each other‚Äù but I can see the toll it takes on her. I‚Äôm scared to be alone right now. 

I was reading books, going to a meditation group, on 10mg of escitalopram, asking for advice from friends and family (not doing well to take it) in the relationship. I wanted the relationship work so badly but I couldn‚Äôt turn my brain off and feel safe / secure. I am going to start with a therapist, but haven‚Äôt had much luck with the last ones for fit. 

I just started a new job - calm, peaceful super nice team - and I want to do everything to keep it and not burnout or f up. 

Friends are always supportive but I still feel lonely and without a community. Even though I have wonderful individual friends. How is that possible? 

Please help me - mindfulness? What to do?

Even saying trying to be ‚Äúperfect‚Äù sounds so cringe to me because I know I‚Äôm far from it, or anything in life really is.

perfectionism,Scared and other words,"I am so scared to do things because they might not turn out well or could result in complete failure. It feels like I‚Äôm stuck in place. I have an essay to write, but the thought of it not being perfect scares me. I spend hours overthinking, searching for the right moment or the perfect idea, but it never comes. It‚Äôs as if I can‚Äôt do anything because I‚Äôm terrified it won‚Äôt work out, and I‚Äôll end up miserable.

Since my TOEFL results (99/120), I‚Äôve lost my self-confidence. If I invest time and effort into something that fails, it feels like it reflects who I am‚Äîthat there‚Äôs something inherently wrong with me. I end up believing I‚Äôm just stupid, the one who failed the essay, the one who can‚Äôt come up with ideas.

perfectionism,Can't choose one thing,"Guys I need help. I have so much trouble making decisions. One of the biggest reasons that I have trouble making decisions is that when you choose one thing you can't then do the other thing. So sometimes I get so scared of missing out on something that I do nothing. I don't even try. So i miss out on everything.

  
Another thing is that i listen to a lot of motivational speakers. there is a place for motivational speakers. But sometimes motivational speakers make me feel like I have to be a ""hero."" Being a hero is admirable. But when I feel like the only way to face the world is to either do nothing or be a hero life feels pretty impossible. I have some things that I really want to do. But my brain is telling me I shouldn't do what i want to do I should do the hardest thing or I'm going to miss out on something. For example, I want to travel the world. But my brain is telling me I need to become a pilot. I honestly don't even really want to become a pilot. I don't like having the stress of making split second decisions and this is also the opposite of my personality type. Another thing is too, I like being comfortable. I would rather a remote job or a desk job. Is it wrong to want to be comfortable? or to do things you actually enjoy? But then my brain is telling me if I want to become a pilot i should do it now because i may never have another chance. But i don't even really want to be a pilot. that sounds like torture. I just want to get away from an abusive relationship. But my brain is telling me there's all these things that I'm missing out on if I don't do the hardest things possible like becoming a pilot, doctor, or lawyer, all things that don't sound at all appealing to me. 

  
I need to focus on getting away from abuse. But then my brain tells me that I need to focus on being the best version of myself or I'm going to miss out and waste my life. But I'm wasting my life more by being paralyzed. I'm wasting my life more by trying not to waste my life because then I do nothing. I don't tryst myself with decisions so I'll just listen to someone else and end up doing something that is the opposite of what I want to do. 

  
The ""you can do anything"" thinking makes me more paralyzed. I've heard that some motivational speakers as you to imagine all you could do in an alternate reality. This may work for some people but for me I imagine this amazing unattainable life that seems so hard to achieve it paralyzes me. Think man in the high castle.

But whenever I very to do this my brain tells me that I'm doing something super irrational and stupid. So then I stop. Either I stop or I go foward and jsut do it halfway. The thing is this: some fear is good and some is bad? So simply going towards fear can't be the compass because some fear keeps us safe. Please help me with this problem. 

  
I just want to make a decision even if I fail. But every decision I look towards, when I try to make it my brain talks me out of it and tells me I'm being irrational and stupid.

perfectionism,I‚Äôve been working out consistently for 3 months!,"Did I do the 12 week running plan I wanted to? NO! I switched to an easier one because I was even more unfit than I realized.

Did I REGULARLY only do 1/2-3/4 of my exercise routine because life got in the way? YES and I patted myself on the back and showed up again anyway.

Did I spend more time researching exercise and how to do it just right than actually exercising? YES but not by that much! Just like 60/40 and I call that a win!

Did I often have to walk during my run intervals because I was unfit/ at a traffic light/ it was getting late? YES but I still counted it because it's way too demotivating not to.

Did I lose weight at the rate I planned to? YES but I made sure it was a really low sustainable goal. Did I panic during that 3 week plateau when I wasn't losing at all? Haha yes but I made it through without freaking out too much ok

Am I on week 3 of the running plan even though I've been doing it for 8 weeks? YES, I've had to do a lot of repeats but I managed to show up for runs 2-3/week CONSISTENTLY and week 3 is way better than week 0!!

Did I stick to easier workouts so I wouldn't get so sore and be more tempted to quit? YES and I was incredibly frustrating and I still hate it a little. At least I'm not doing wall push ups anymore, I felt so dumb

Most importantly, do I feel happier, healthier, fitter, and stronger?? SO MUCH YES! It turns out half assing it for several months is so much better than whole assing it for a couple weeks! Who could have thought??

perfectionism,Perfectly Imperfect - Breaking free from the trap,"During an event, while giving a keynote speech over how perfectionism can be an effective deterrent to someone‚Äôs growth and realisation of their goals, one of the attendees Sridhar (name changed) interrupted and said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think Perfectionism is all that bad. I find that it‚Äôs an average man‚Äôs excuse to continue doing average work‚Äù. I listened to him carefully & patiently, and enquired to know more about what he means.
He continued, ‚ÄúI have a dream goal, to write a book on Gardening and I have been working on it for years. I know I‚Äôm taking time but I want to do it right. I want to make sure that when my audience reads it, they know in much clarity and exactness of what I want to convey. The knowledge transfer should be complete and elaborate. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with being thorough. I would hate for someone to buy my book and feel cheated because the content was surface level ‚ÄúGyaan‚Äù. I don‚Äôt want them to think that the author didn‚Äôt even consider doing an extensive and in-depth research, or doesn‚Äôt know much.‚Äù
What he said was not wrong ‚Äì no one is ever wrong ‚Äì just a different perspective.
Sure! There‚Äôs absolutely no sidestepping the need for extensive research and quality of the product/service you wish to provide. But, there‚Äôs a question that we should be asking ourselves ‚Äì ‚ÄúAre these steps in the process - whether preparation, analysing, ideation, researching, getting the right inputs or waiting for something ‚Äì taking justifiable time for the realisation of your goal, or whether, they are unconscious tools to avoid and escape from facing & experiencing emotions we are not ready for.
Perfectionism -  that says if I‚Äôm any less than perfect, I would have to face the same criticism, judgement, mockery, punishment, abandonment that I had to face earlier when my work had flaws, and discrepancies, or wasn‚Äôt good enough for what the recipient expected. I felt shame or I was made to feel shame, for not going a great job. And as a result, I want to make sure I‚Äôm thorough this time. I don‚Äôt want to leave any gaps.
And in this regards, they want to delay as much as possible, approaching the finish line. In fact, they have unconsciously made a vow to themselves, on the level of body intelligence, that says ‚Äúmake sure I don‚Äôt get to reach the end and face those emotions‚Äù. With this thought process, surely ‚Äì you would never be happy with your work, with your progress.
Many clients, who walk into my door for therapy sessions, come up with an issue that they feel they‚Äôre stuck in a rut to do things. They feel they cannot relax ‚Äì they have to be productive. Being productive for living/working purposefully is great but sometimes, we want to pursue greatness and just work all the time, and be perfect ‚Äì because there‚Äôs a voice inside our head that says you‚Äôre not good enough, that you‚Äôre unworthy and incapable. Because you don‚Äôt want to listen to that voice and those harsh words, that can cause inner pain, we look for ways to avoid them. We unconsciously come up with adaptive strategies, that to our conscious mind says ‚Äì ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an pursuer of excellence‚Äù but underneath, sabotages our growth, success in that endeavour, inner peace and worse of all, our sense of self-worth.
5 Steps to Counter and Heal Perfectionism
1. Acknowledge the Emotional Root
Action: Investigate, explore about the emotions you feel when you fall short of your own expectations. Ask yourself: What am I avoiding or afraid to feel? Common emotions include shame, fear of rejection, or inadequacy. If possible, journal them ‚Äì write them out.
Ask yourself: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the worst that could happen if I‚Äôm not perfect?‚Äù to uncover hidden fears.

2. Practice Emotional Regulation
Action: When perfectionist tendencies arise, pause and practice grounding techniques like deep breathing or EFT (I do that, in my sessions and workshops quite often).
Exercise: Try the ‚Äú5-4-3-2-1 technique‚Äù to ground yourself: Identify 5 things you see, 4 you hear, 3 you can touch, 2 you smell, and 1 you taste.

3. Embrace ‚ÄúGood Enough‚Äù as Progress, Not Failure
Action: Set realistic, flexible goals instead of unattainable standards. Celebrate small wins to build confidence and reframe your mindset.
Affirmations: ‚ÄúDone is better than perfect,‚Äù or ‚ÄúProgress, not perfection.‚Äù

4. Cultivate Self-Compassion
Action: Replace self-criticism with kind, positive and empathetic self-talk. Reflect on how you would comfort a friend facing similar struggles and offer yourself the same kindness.
Practice: Loving-kindness meditation: ‚ÄúMay I be kind to myself. May I accept myself as I am. May I grow and learn with ease.‚Äù

5. Face and Process Difficult Emotions
Action: Dedicate time to consciously feel and allow yourself to process difficult emotions. I help my clients with guided journaling, Art therapy, or Hypnotherapy to explore these feelings in a safe environment.
Journal: What did this emotion teach me? What do I need to heal or move forward?

Conclusion:
With patience and practice, you can heal ‚ÄúPerfectionism‚Äù. By acknowledging, and accepting the emotions you‚Äôre trying to escape, you learn to trust yourself and embrace life with authenticity, not perfection.

I think in a way this does play a part in the obsessive, obsessive thoughts I have, day in, day out. But now, after 10+ years, on a random Wednesday, I finally figured it out.

I am a perfectionist because, if I‚Äôm perfect, then no one will have a reason to dislike me, right?¬†

I guess for more context, I also have autism; I was pulled out of school at a very young age because of neglectful parents and intense, intense bullying; I‚Äôm generally seen as an awkward adult; estranged from the world around me; I haven‚Äôt had proper socialization with my peers since I was a child. I took these times of isolation to learn skills‚Äîcreative writing, video editing, sewing, scanlation, photography, and many more things‚Äîbut despite it all, it‚Äôs never enough.
¬†
I have creative writing deadlines; I can‚Äôt even bring myself to start them because if it‚Äôs not perfect, then I‚Äôll get bullied, right? I‚Äôve often seen many people in online spaces around me grow genuine connections and friendships over their creations‚Äîart, music, you make it.¬†

So I guess in some way, I applied that logic to myself along the way of my development; if I‚Äôm perfect at my hobbies, then I‚Äôll get that community I crave. I‚Äôll have people like me, right? That must be how it works.¬†

I know this isn‚Äôt logical; I‚Äôve been to therapy for years now, but that perfectionism is something I just can‚Äôt drop.

perfectionism,Building a Routine: One of the Hardest Challenges for a Perfectionist,"In the last two weeks, I've made a lot of progress against my perfectionistic habits. My plan has been to make my tasks and habits as small as possible to avoid slipping into perfectionism. I've noticed intense urges pushing me to do more and aim for perfection, but I‚Äôve been choosing to ignore them to focus on healing from this mindset.

Recently, I decided to implement a routine to give my day some structure and keep me from falling into inactivity. But wow, I've felt a huge amount of anxiety and stress while trying to stick to it. It‚Äôs like my mind insists on making the routine perfect, executing every task flawlessly, and finding more time for each task than the day can realistically hold.

For example, if I want to exercise, my mind says, ""Why not watch 10 videos on the perfect exercises, create the ideal plan, and then do cardio, stretching, and strength training , all at once?""  
If I want to relax with friends, thoughts like, ""What about the work waiting for you, or all the habits you need to stick to? Is chilling really productive, or are you just wasting time?"" start to creep in.  
And reading a book? ""Twenty pages a day isn‚Äôt enough; maybe you should read 50 to make real progress!""

So many different thoughts like these flood in, making my efforts feel pointless unless I do everything perfectly and cram what could be done over four days into a single session , all out of fear that I might ""miss out"" on something without even knowing what it is.

Despite all this, one of the best practices I‚Äôve adopted daily is reminding myself that I‚Äôm not late for anything. As long as I‚Äôm seeking personal growth and aiming to be better than yesterday, I know I‚Äôm moving forward. Telling myself that the journey, not the results, is what brings happiness has been crucial. By accepting that I can‚Äôt perfect everything, only then do I feel like I'm moving closer to becoming perfect.

I am conflicted with how I feel because I am a very attractive, fairly intelligent/intellectual (English major + ENVS major) but mostly I'm smart (meaning the way in which I live my life, the way I take care of myself, the way I take care of others), I have cool hobbies like reading, I'm beginning to play the guitar, I go hiking, I workout and I'm in great shape for most standards, (Sorry to go there) but I have a decent appendage attached to me, and I have a beautiful girlfriend who has been in love with me for 11 months now, and my family is pretty affluent.

Also, my friends/friend group I am close with but I'm not VERY close with, like they are with each other; Even though I was there from the beginning and they all still love to see me. Or maybe I am thinking that they're closer with each other than me because I don't have these super well-attached intimate relationships that I strive for (through my perfectionism). It's almost like unless we're best friends or are deep as fuck with each other I don't feel like they're my friend ar my core. Basically an overinflated sense of what true friendship is. I am also thinking that me and my girlfriend are going to break up now because I am in this panic state while we're both trying navigate our academic lives, deal with election results, and keep our anxious worrying minds from absolutely ripping ourselves to shreds. Well... mine at least is doing that pretty affectively right now. She has been super supportive of me saying that she is going to be here no matter what but I feel like my real needs might exceed what her expectations of being here for me actually means. 

Additional to all of this, my addiction in life besides being a perfectionist is talking about my feelings. It feels good but in the excessive amounts that I have been doing, it has been feeding into my anxious fit and it doesn't seem to help me ever. BUT I KEEP DOING IT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW ITS THE ONLY THING I HAVE ON MY MIND. I feel a lil insane right now but I'm trying to get little things done to feel like I'm accomplishing things.

perfectionism,I made a cake yesterday and it was underdone and it ruined my whole weekend so far,"The cake looked beautiful and took a couple hours and I was proud of it.  Then I ate a bite and like the title says it was underdone in the middle, and I was like ‚Äúyou stupid idiot look what you did, what a waste of time‚Äù.

perfectionism,I am an incomplete computer,"I run on functions(tactic) programs(operations)and systems(strategy) aligning all of these together is impossible because all functions are stacked to make an operation and operations are stacked are called a system and my systems are never complete due to the building blocks of my functions being incorrect or the non most efficient method of competing programs 

There are many operations that cannot be perfect due to my inability to master or find the correct functions to execute. Therefore my systems are flawed 
This may seems crazy to readers so I am prepared to give a handful of examples 
Ex.1 I cannot clean my house. Not because I am physically unable to clean my house but because I cannot store my clothing properly because the space in my closet has to formatted to fit my clothing the bar upon which my clothes hang needs to be raised. You would say why not move the bar up then It‚Äôs two simple clips and a drill for the screws. But it is not it is the drywall hole which I will have to patch and paint but I am not proficient at drywall so therefore I must delve into being proficient in drywall and paints and now that I must be proficient in drywall I must be proficient in knowledge of drywall and its tools and how to work them and now I must know how to be proficient in paints 
And now that this knowledge is present to me I know it is to vast for me to learn to do so this project is overwhelmed 
And my kitchen is a mess I must put the spices in the spice rack but the spice rack is full so I must build a spice rack holder but I am not proficient in woodworking I have some tools but not proficient enough to have it in my house so I must delve into it but I know the price of the tools and the knowledge of woodworking is too much and to vast for me to learn so I am overwhelmed 
I know there is a more proficient way of dealing with dirty laundry it is simple and I am a machine I wash all my work clothes for the week and I fold my clothes and have my socks underwear and shirts and pants for the week laid out on my counter so I may wake up and immediately go to dress 

When I acquire items that I have not invented a place for it to live it is set down on a cluttered counter with the rest of the items that are forgotten until they need to serve me again often times I cannot remember the place 
My house is unclean able due to my inability to place things and to fix things and to know how to fix them 

Often times I have trouble finding the energy to become proficient and masterful of these things and there is very few things I have patience to be consistent on 
These thoughts explains to all areas of my life work home non physical relationships and activities how to be more efficient and efficient how to be perfect 
I feel often the problem is at my core the building blocks upon which I operate on and I target relearning proper methods of cleaning and maintaining to eliminate time usage so I can begin to focus on operations and not functions",,"Concern Over Mistakes, Personal Standards, Organization"
perfectionism,Does Anyone Else with OCD Struggle with Device Settings Anxiety?,"Hey everyone, hopefully everyone has a peaceful day today. I have a question:

How come I cannot find any information about OCD related to settings, like PC/laptop/smartphone/apps/games/etc.? I have OCD, perfectionism, hardship with control, uncertainty and doubts as well as tricks my mind plays with not remembering, and I want my settings to be maxed out‚Äîfor example, maximum brightness all the time, maximum screen resolution, best performance, best experience, etc. And I believe there is nothing wrong with wanting things your way.

I guess it‚Äôs all-or-nothing kinda thinking, and settings cause me anxiety. Feeling uncertain if it‚Äôs perfect/maximum, if I missed something, didn‚Äôt see, unchecked or checked something accidentally when exiting, or if I didn‚Äôt check for a long time and now I forgot, is hard when dealing with anything that has settings. The funny part is that I loved tweaking before, but now it‚Äôs like the scariest part ever, especially when there‚Äôs no save button and it doesn‚Äôt save automatically.

I understand that all OCD themes are inherently the same, but I never see anything related to settings. Does anyone have the same thing? How do people who have perfectionism OCD just not care about settings? It‚Äôs like a perfect place for uncertainty and doubts to take over, which is a core part of OCD. Are there any resources related to dealing with this specific problem?

I guess the most surprising is how I feel that I am the only one who is worried about settings and nobody else has this. Thanks!",,"Concern Over Mistakes, Doubts About Actions, Personal Standards"
perfectionism,feel like giving up (tw),"tw: suicidal thoughts 

 where to go. Idk where to turn. 

i spent my entire life working towards my career. getting straight A‚Äôs in school, working all night to perfect an assignment, taking on additional work, etc. just for me to get subpar performance reviews and job rejections left and right.

I just applied to a job that accepted 5 people for a government pathways program in my field. 150 applicants max. I got rejected after the first interview. This is shortly after getting rejected from my dream job, that I worked my ass to interview for and after plenty of other rejection. 

I‚Äôve wasted my time and money to be worthless. The horrible thing is that I want kids, and my husband and I were planning on having kids soon, but I can‚Äôt even fathom having kids if I can‚Äôt even find a job (I have a job right now but job security is not great). I‚Äôve been applying for over a year, yall. Over a year. 

I feel like I‚Äôm at my last straw and trying everything to keep myself alive, mentally. I just want to end it. The rest of my life is great, but it doesn‚Äôt matter if I can‚Äôt afford it. I don‚Äôt know where to go from here. I‚Äôm miserable in my current job too. Idk.",,"Personal Standards, Organization"
perfectionism,Why does degeneracy offers better results than discipline?,"In my case I track my ""progress"" by playing video games and my whole life I stayed discipline and dedicated to be the best , I took an unexpected break , And not recently I saw that I my results are better when I am degenerate and ""please"" myself multiple times instead of being dedicated and maybe doing it occasionally when I achieve something big , why is that . I thought people that are less sexually active have better results, why my performance proves otherwise , am I sick ?",,Personal Standards
perfectionism,How did you find out you have perfectionism?,"I just found out I have some perfectionism tendencies related to my appearance (how I look/how I‚Äôm perceived etc). I think it really started 2 years ago and just gotten worse and worse ever since. I didn‚Äôt know it was perfectionism tendencies tho, but I asked chat gpt a prompt I saw online ‚Äúbased on our past interections what do you know about me that I might not know‚Äù and it mentioned that I have some perfectionism tendencies, I haven‚Äôt even thought that what I‚Äôm thinking and feeling are caused by that

(Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm an actual perfectionist, I still don‚Äôt everything about it, but the ‚Äútendencies‚Äù part really sums about how I am when it comes to my appearance, and now I‚Äôm curious about how others live with it and how it shows up for others)

So I‚Äôm curious, how did you find out you are a perfectionist?",,"Concern Over Mistakes, Personal Standards"
perfectionism,"Skills for perfectionist beliefs? (Maybe dbt emotional regulation, opposite action?)","So, my self worth is really dependent on my intelligence. I feel like if I make a mistake, I‚Äôm convinced I‚Äôm stupid or less intelligent and therefore I‚Äôm worth less or literally worthless. I feel a rush of self hatred and like I need to feel bad for what I did and must therefore be punished to be cleared of the mistake and deserving of forgiveness, like some sort of catharsis.

But I know that following those impulses will only reinforce the beliefs. I can not change the way I think because even though I technically know it‚Äôs probably not the truth, I can‚Äôt deny that deep inside I truly believe those thoughts. Telling myself  the opposite just doesn‚Äôt stick.

So I think I need to change my reaction to the thoughts to show my brain, that mistakes are not followed my punishments and therefore not that bad?

The question is, what do I do instead? I need to practice opposite action but I don‚Äôt know what that could look like. Doing something nice to me when I feel like I need to suffer is‚Ä¶not easy.",,"Concern Over Mistakes, Personal Standards"
perfectionism,Hyper-fixated on mistakes and perfection,"I‚Äôm getting so caught up in things being perfect I‚Äôm making more mistakes. I made like one mistake three months ago and my brain hyper fixated on that. My brain kept giving me thoughts like, ‚Äúit‚Äôs too late. There‚Äôs no hope.‚Äù And now in hindsight that was like the smallest mistake in the world. And because of that one I made so many more. So I constantly have like the last thing in my head that I did. And my actions and decisions are never perfect. So I have this constant narrative of, ‚Äúit‚Äôs too late there‚Äôs no hope. You already ruined everything.‚Äù It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm aiming for perfection so I feel I keep tripping from one mistake to the next because perfection is unattainable. The only mindset I can think of is just to look past mistakes more. Like that‚Äôs how you overcame binge eating. I didn‚Äôt sweat ‚Äúmistakes.‚Äù Like I started building up my tolerance for eating by ‚Äúbad‚Äù foods. So it wasn‚Äôt this constant back and forth if perfect then mistake. Perfect, eating everything right one day. Then the next day I have like one ‚Äúbad‚Äù thing and I would binge. So I stopped labeling as good and bad.

Another thing is too is the perfectionism. Kind of like I talked about the all or nothing thinking with eating, I also have all or nothing with just everyday life. I‚Äôm under a hell of a lot of pressure right now and in a super stressful position. But anyway I have this tendency to think like ‚Äúok I‚Äôm being perfect now I‚Äôm spit my work,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing nothing,‚Äù which then involves me like trying to escape reality by I don‚Äôt know looking at my phone and then I feel ‚Äúguilty‚Äù when really I probably should give myself some much needed rest. This is how it used to be with food when I used to feel like shit about myself for eating ‚Äúbad‚Äù food until I finally built up my tolerance. Any advice on how to overcome this? Like how can I take the pressure off of myself in reality, that way I don‚Äôt feel the need to escape reality? That way I can face it, even though I am in a very stressful position right now.",,"Concern Over Mistakes, Parental Expectations & Criticism, Personal Standards"
perfectionism,How to enjoy life and stop waiting for it to be perfect?,"I've been diagnosed with a whole load of things that have affected my life. Depression, C-PTSD etc. They've controlled my life for years and made me miserable until I decided enough is enough. Alongside regular therapy I've made the decision to attempt to enjoy (romanticize) life more but im finding it extremely challenging. I think my issue might be that I'm too focused on the perfectionism side of things. I have created a daily routine that's just huge it includes so many tasks like 'practice a hobby, read, meditate' I don't know if I am trying to control my life too much. I'm also finding it really hard to find joy in small things because I get so worried about it being perfect, I don't understand how people can find happiness in little moments because it feels like if I don't have someone telling me what to romanticise then I am doing it wrong, so how do I stop and just start trying to be happier rather than worry so much about doing it wrong?",,"Concern Over Mistakes, Personal Standards"
